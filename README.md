# Quick Guide



##Overview

There are two types of games on the platform:

+ For the system type created by the platform, the rule is that players select any option and set the amount to bet. When the game lottery time is up, the system will randomly select an option, and the winner will be divided according to the bet proportion.

+ It is a type created by players (dealers). The player sets the amount to bet. After the game draws a prize, the system will generate a random number for each player and the dealer. The random value of each player is compared with the dealer. If it is large, the player wins. Otherwise, the player loses. If the player wins, he or she will get an equivalent bet.



Platform token reward

+ There will be corresponding token rewards for players to place bets (multiple of bet amount)

+ Banker pledge will also have corresponding token reward (multiple of pledge amount)

- (The reward multiple will decrease according to the circulation)

+ Tokens can be converted into matic, depending on the profitability of the platform (and the revenue in the contract)



Platform revenue

+ Players will charge a fee of less than 10% according to a certain proportion after making a profit

+ The dealer will charge the same proportion as the player when redeeming the pledge

+ 80% of the above two fees will be in the contract, and 20% will be used for community development



##How to become a banker



When the pledge is greater than 10 math, you can create games and become a dealer by yourself. The banker's pledge can be redeemed in time. The player's total bet amount is less than the banker's pledge amount to avoid insufficient compensation.
